# Super's Minecraft Recommendations
***Note that this is not affiliated with MinecraftHopper, Minecraft Community Support, Prism, Modrinth, Fabric, Quilt or anyone else.***

This is just a funni list of recommendations from me and I really recommend you do research yourself before installing anything listed here. **Please do not ever blindly follow anything you see online.**

# What should be avoided?
* ### Uncommon Minecraft Mod Distrobution Sites
	* A good portion of sites for Minecraft mods have malware or steal mods. I'd only recommend using [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com), [MCArchive](https://mcarchive.net/), [GitHub](https://github.com).
	* [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com) may be used for mods made for legacy versions, however CurseForge is known to be substatially more dangerous than the suggestions above.  
* ### Hamachi 
	* Will cause connection issues. 
	* See E4MC or [playit.gg](https://playit.gg) for alternatives.
* ### MCLeaks/TheAltening 
	* Stolen/Illegal account generator. 
	* Follow [this Minecraft Hopper article](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/hosts-file/) for fix/removal.
* ### In Game Purchases 
	* Things like paid cosmetics are against [Minecraft's End User License Agreement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula). Refer to ```Any Mods you create for Minecraft: Java Edition from scratch belong to you (including pre-run Mods and in-memory Mods) and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don't sell them for money / try to make money from them and so long as you donâ€™t distribute Modded Versions of the game```. Although from what I can tell, they aren't in violation of the [Minecraft Usage Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines), so from my understanding, they technically aren't doing anything wrong but I'm going to keep this here anyways :3
	* This includes OptiFine, Essential, Badlion, Feather and Lunar.
	* I'm honestly not sure why these mods aren't taken down. My assumption is either too much of a PR disaster with some of these, or not worth it. Interestingly, Mojang actually did send a cease and desist to [Physics Mod](https://minecraftphysicsmod.com) for having a patreon paid version.
	* \* Refer to Figura below for *free* cosmetic alternatives
* ### Most Clients and Launchers
	* Some clients will directly login to your account instead of asking for permission, which is known as oAuth. This means the client has FULL access to your Microsoft account. Whilst logging on, launchers should provide you with a code to put into a web browser on the official Microsoft login website. ***If the client you are using requires direct login to your Microsoft account, immediately uninstall the launcher and change your Microsoft Account Password. The client has FULL ACCESS TO YOUR MICROSOFT ACCOUNT AND A MINECRAFT CLIENT OR LAUNCHER SHOULD NEVER NEED THIS.*** 
	* Most clients are closed source, meaning you cannot see the code for the client. This alone is a red flag. 
	* These clients directly modify the game's code and could be doing literally anything to your computer. While this is true for mods, usually mods are in atleast some kind of sandbox.
	* Mods or clients should NEVER ask for administrator permissions after installation.
	* These clients have invasive privacy policies where they can collect information about you that Minecraft itself doesn't even collect. A Minecraft client should NEVER need access to your internet activity, geo-location, phone number, home address?!?!?!?! WHY IS THIS IN LUNAR CLIENT'S PRIVACY POLICY??!?!?!? THEY CAN EVEN SELL IT TO OTHER COMPANIES?!??!??!?!?!?
	* Usually these clients contain paid goodies, refer to the above section for why that's bad.
* ### Badlion Client 
	* At a simple glance, their privacy policy seems less suspicious than Lunar Client's however they sell cosmetics. 	
	* Refer to [Most Clients and Launchers](https://github.com/superpowers04/superpowers04/blob/main/Super's%20Fabric%20Mod%20Recommendations.md#most-clients-and-launchers).
* ### Feather Client 
	* Steals mods/has stolen mods in the past.
	* Suspicious behavior.
	* Refer to [Most Clients and Launchers](https://github.com/superpowers04/superpowers04/blob/main/Super's%20Fabric%20Mod%20Recommendations.md#most-clients-and-launchers).
* ### Lunar Client 
	* Suspicious behavior like obfuscating logs, by the way, obfuscating logs can make it difficult to troubleshoot what's going on with your game if you encounter an issue
	* I remember an issue where Lunar Client had broken hit detection for a short period of time, not sure if this was actually true, if so, it shouldn't be editing player behavior
	* Several people have encountered Lunar Client acting like an Alt account generator, causing the game to disallow them from joining servers. IF you get a "Switch to Mojang Mode" error, that's Lunar Client and you should switch away immediately and change your Microsoft account's password
	* [Their privacy policy](https://www.lunarclient.com/privacy) is sus as hell, IF you plan on continuing to use lunar client for whatever reason, please please look at it and fully grasp what they're using. Like, A Minecraft client should NEVER need access to your Internet activity, geo-location, phone number, or home address?!?!?!?! WHY IS THIS IN LUNAR CLIENT'S PRIVACY POLICY??!?!?!?
	* Refer to [Most Clients and Launchers](https://github.com/superpowers04/superpowers04/blob/main/Super's%20Fabric%20Mod%20Recommendations.md#most-clients-and-launchers).
* ### TLauncher 
	* Piracy.
	* Steals mods.
	* Installs suspicious certificates onto your computer.
	* Stole the name and some other drama with TL Legacy/TL Legacy Launcher.
	* Refer to [In Game Purchases]([url](https://github.com/superpowers04/superpowers04/blob/main/Super's%20Fabric%20Mod%20Recommendations.md#in-game-purchases)).
* ### CurseForge/CurseForge Launcher
	* CurseForge has had issues with malware, weird practices(allowed illegal copies of Iris/Sodium for a while) and has been superseded by Modrinth in multiple ways. 
	* I'd **only** recommend using curseforge if you can't find a mod on Modrinth or MCArchive, for older versions of the game or if you have to.
        * Refer to the suggested mod loaders at the top of this page.
* ### OptiFine
	* Has violated Minecraft's EULA several times in the past.
 	* Closed source, basically nobody can see the source code. This is really bad for mod compatibility, which should be a huge worry for a mod that used to be essential for your mod list.
	* Can cause a lot of issues due to how it changes rendering.
 	* [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mods/sodium)/[Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mods/Embeddium) provides far better performance and you can find alternatives with more features.
	* \* Note: If you're using any Minecraft version below 1.14, most mods usually expect OptiFine.
* ### Essential 
	* Often force installed by other mods that rely on Essential.
	* Refer to [In Game Purchases]([url](https://github.com/superpowers04/superpowers04/blob/main/Super's%20Fabric%20Mod%20Recommendations.md#in-game-purchases)).
	* \* Refer to Figura below for a *free* cosmetics alternative and refer to E4MC below for a hosting alternative.

# Recommendations
* ### [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) 
	* Open sourced, lightweight, ethical owners, and fufills all the tasks that CurseForge does.
* ### [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) 
	* Fabric is more lightweight than Forge, and since the loader isn't dependant on Minecraft version, you'll usually get a fabric release within the first few days of a Minecraft update.
* ### [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/) 
	* Quilt is like fabric but adds some extra features. If you use QSL you are able to load Fabric mods alongside Quilt mods.
* ### [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net)
	* NeoForge is a fork of Forge that provides a better developer experience and a more performant experience. With [Sinytra](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector), you can add support for a good portion of Fabric-only mods. Note that doing this is unstable, and may cause issues.
* ### [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org) 
	* An fork/drop-in replacement of MultiMC that allows downloading mods within the launcher, has a whole bunch of fixes and improvements. This is the launcher I currently use.
* ### [MultiMC](https://multimc.org) 
	* An advanced lightweight Minecraft Launcher that's portable, allows multiple instances of the game without too much hassle, and easy installing of mod loaders like Fabric. Superseded by Prism Launcher, but is still a valid option.
* ### [MCArchive](https://mcarchive.net) 
	* A archive of older Minecraft mods, it's open source and maintained by the community. It gives links to the original download if it's still available, links to the author and doesn't have any advertisments.
* ### [Stop Mod Reposts](https://stopmodreposts.org) 
	* While not currently being maintained, this is an extension that warns you if you're going on a page known for reposting mods. It also contains malicious ratings.

<br>

### Fabric/Quilt
  * [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium): Optimizes the client.
  * [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium): A fork of Sodium, it has some Fabric builds. It *could* be faster than sodium but I haven't really tested. You cannot use both this and Sodium.
  * [Sodium Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-extra): Extra options for sodium.
  * [Reeses Sodium Options](https://modrinth.com/mod/reeses-sodium-options): Allows you to access said options, only required for Sodium as Embeddium integrates this mod already.

<br>

# Modding Your Game - Optional Additions

### Peformance Mods
* [SomeAddon Project](https://www.curseforge.com/members/someaddon/projects): As much as I prefer to stay away from curseforge, SomeAddon has some amazing optimization mods for both client and server. I personally use these mods on my own modpacks as often as I can, they usually don't break anything.
* [Immediately Fast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast): This mod can help with FPS, however it has incompatibilities with some mods since it does a lot for rendering.
* [Ferrite Core](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core): Memory Usage optimizations. I've seen a few mods that don't work with this.
* [Krypton](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton): Optimizes networking.
* [Dash Loader](https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader): Drastically improves game load time. Often has incompatibilities.
* [Noisium](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium): Optimizes world generation.
* [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons): Allows you to see far past your render distance without causing lag. However this mod only works with some setups and is very very buggy
* [Bobby](https://modrinth.com/mod/bobby): Allows for render distances greater than the server's view-distance setting by caching chunks and using the cache. In some ways, this could theroetically help with network issues.
* [Raknetify](https://modrinth.com/plugin/raknetify): A mod that allows you to join servers with the mod via raknet. This can supposedly help with network instability.
* [Not Enough Recipe Book](https://modrinth.com/mod/nerb): A mod that removes the recipe book from the game, the game stores ALL of your recipes in your NBT which can cause network lag and Minecraft isn't exactly optimised at handling recipes either. Note that if you still want recipes you'll need EMI or JEI, and in order for this to work it must be installed on both the client and the server.
* [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi): EMI is basically Not Enough Items ported to modern versions of Minecraft. For better mod compatibility, you'll probably also want [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei). While they technically do the same thing, EMI has more customization options and (in my experience) is lighter than JEI. EMI will basically use JEI to support more mods without actually using JEI.

<br>

### OptiFine Alternatives
* [Puzzle](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle): A mod that adds some optifine features, an API and some other things.
* [Animatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/animatica): Support for Optifine/MCPatcher's animated textures.
* [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features): Support for random textures on entities, and some other things.
* [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features): Support for Optifine Custom Entity models. Requires ETF.
* [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn): MCPatcher/Optifine CIT features.
* [Zoomify](https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomify): A mod that allows you to zoom (Requires YACL).
* [Lamb Dynamic Lights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights): What is says on the tin, dynamic lighting.
* [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity): Connected Textures.

  <br>

### Extras
* [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura/): A completely client sided mod that allows you to use custom [BlockBench](https://blockbench.net/) player models that can be scripted with [Lua](https://lua.org). Avatars can be seen by other players that have the mod without the server needing the mod.
* [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports): "This mod strips cryptographic signatures that since 1.19 are attached to every message sent in the chat. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account." TL;DR: Removes the thing required to allow your chat messages to be reported to Microsoft/Mojang. ***Note, you might need to disable this on some servers.***
* [E4MC](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc): Replacement for Essential's multiplayer.
* [Custom Lan](https://modrinth.com/mod/custom-lan): A mod that adds a bunch of options for hosting a world that supports tunneling.
* [LAN World Plug-n-Play](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcwifipnp): A mod that automatically port-forwards your lan world using UPnP. Please note UPnP is extremely unreliable, and may not function for the majority of people.
* [ViaFabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabric)/[ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus): A mod that allows you to join servers of different versions. Note that this does alot of packet manipulation and can be seen as cheating or trigger anticheats on some servers like Hypixel. ViaFabric has less support than ViaFabricPlus but is more stable and updates faster in my experience.
