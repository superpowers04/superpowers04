 * She/her


# Basic biography
I am currently a Minecraft Community Support Helper that is probably inactive a lot more than I should be and I am an admin for the Psych Engine Discord

> [!CAUTION]
> <b>Due to events being caused by a comic causing me to question a lot about myself, anything beyond this point might not be accurate at the moment, If you're curious about something, please directly ask me about it.</b><br>
> <sub>* The comic is [Rain](https://comicfury.com/comicprofile.php?url=rain), it's a good comic you should read. You might want to read it across multiple days, not all in one 17-20 hour sitting like I did, else it'll hit you like a ton of bricks</sub>

> [!CAUTION]
**If you're going to DM me, and talking about NSFW stuff bothers you or you're younger than 18, Please tell me.** <br>
  <sup>You should also let me know if NSFW(Specifically sexual NSFW) stuff doesn't bother you, so I can better control how I talk to you :3</sup>
* If I say something that bothers you, Please let me know :>
* I can avoid saying NSFW stuff in more professional settings(Minecraft Community Support for example), when talking to minors or if asked
* If you have a question or need help with something, Please send me the question instead of saying that you need help or pinging me
  - It makes response times from me faster because I can immediately respond to you instead of having to respond and then wait for you to type out your message 
  <sub>then it's a question about if you can get your Minecraft Java Account back because it got hacked and I have to inform you that I do not work for Mojank and then you get mad at me because you had to wait 5 hours for a response because I was ASLEEP a-</sub> wait, what was I talking about again? oh right
* ### I don't work for Mojang
  * None of the helpers or admins in Minecraft Community Support are affiliated with Mojang or Microsoft. We cannot help with account issues or recover your account. Please contact Microsoft or Mojang, all I can do is provide help for getting the funny little block game to work on your computer
* This goober forgets about the existance of people that haven't been interacted with in the past day. So if I randomly stop messaging you, don't take it personally, I do it to literally everyone ~~even family members~~

# Current Projects
* [Super Engine](https://github.com/superpowers04/Super-Engine) - What started out as an extension to Kade Engine 1.4.2 is now a custom FNF engine by me that features a bunch of moddability without source code, options to add new charts and characters without touching a single line of code, a whole bunch of customization options, basic support for charts from Psych Engine, VSlice(0.3.0+ base funkin') and a whole bunch of other engines, all with a new input engine I designed myself and a whole slew of random shit I rewrote. As of writing this, I've been working on this piece of shit for like 3 years(Started late 2021, before Psych Engine even existed !!!!) 
* [Extura](https://github.com/superpowers04/Extura) - A personal fork of [ConstantDust's Figura Fork](https://github.com/ConstantDust/Figura) that adds a bunch of random things I want to add
